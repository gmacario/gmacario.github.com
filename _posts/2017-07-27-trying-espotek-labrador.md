This blog post details my first experiences with the [EspoTek Labrador](https://www.crowdsupply.com/espotek/labrador), a small, portable, USB-connected electronics lab-on-a-board which includes an oscilloscope, waveform generator, power supply, logic analyzer, and multimeter.

Most notably, both hardware and software are Open Source!
