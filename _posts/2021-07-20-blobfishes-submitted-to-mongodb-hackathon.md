TODO: Place one beautiful (or ugly?) picture here

As I anticipated in my [previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-07-17-our-journey-to-do-mongodb-hackathon) a few days ago I joined the [DigitalOcean MongoDB Hackathon](https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/) together with a group of friends.

Even though the official objective of joining the Hackathon is to be awarded a prize, I believe all of us shared a few other goals:
1. We want to learn and explore new web technologies
2. We want to apply best practices which may be useful in our day-to-day jobs...
3. But first of all we want to have fun!

What are we going to develop and submit to the Hackathon?
Stay tuned, I will shed some light very soon...

## What did we eventually develop?

Let me introduce

## Our journey

I learned about the DigitalOcean MongoDB Hackathon when it was launched at the [deploy by DigitalOcean](https://deploy.digitalocean.com/) event at the end of June.

From that day I chased my friends to join me in this effort, but they were reluctant. I may understand why, they already bear with me during the workday, and having to do the same also during their evenings and week-ends is definitely a huge task :wink:

### Project blobfishes kick-off

My friends eventually gave up to my insistence, and on 2021-07-14 when we met in person to agree upon what we could develop in order to get the [wonderful prizes](https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/#prizes) offered by DigitalOcean.

From that moment on we never had the chance of meeting in person; instead, we relied upon tools such as [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/issues).

We soon realized that the time until the closing date of the hackathon ([July 20, 2021, 11:59 pm PST](https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/)) was quite short, therefore we had to cut corners and agreed the scope of work.

As the [blobfishes project page on GitHub](TODO) states

> Blobfishes aims to be the ugliest project participating to the [DigitalOcean MongoDB Hackathon](https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/).

### The RASI

Based on our skills and previous knowledge we also agreed on each [team member role](https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/blob/main/docs/rasic.md).

Hopefully - since I am the eldest and the laziest member of the team - my friends did not ask me to write complex [MongoDB queries](https://docs.mongodb.com/) or arcane [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/docs/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) code, but assigned me the Ops, Deploy and Documentation tasks.

Like a [cherry on top of the ice cream](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-phrase-cherry-on-top#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Ccherry%20on%20top%E2%80%9D%20means,cherry%20is%20put%20on%20top.), I also contributed with my skills of ball-breaker and watchdog which I have refined during my work at [AROL](https://www.arol.com/).

## The deliverables

Well, at the end of the day our setup did work well, as we eventually [managed to have our submission accepted](https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/issues/24#issuecomment-883869551) before the Hackathon closed!

## Next steps

As it is now about time to wake up and go to work here is my short-time action plan:

1. Commit and publish this blog post
2. Shower and shave myself
3. Go to work on time by 08:00 CEST

For a longer time plan, please have a look at the [project backlog](https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/issues).

As the blobfishes project is released under an [Open Source license](https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/blob/main/LICENSE), contributions are welcome :rotfl:
