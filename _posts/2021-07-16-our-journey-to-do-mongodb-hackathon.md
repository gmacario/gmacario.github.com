A few days ago I joined the [DigitalOcean MongoDB Hackathon](https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/) together with a group of friends.

All of us shared a common goal: With the official objective of be awared a prize, we in fact want to learn and explore new technologies which may be useful in our day-to-day job... But first of all we want to have fun!

What are we going to develop and submit to the Hackathon?
Stay tuned, I will shed some light very soon...
