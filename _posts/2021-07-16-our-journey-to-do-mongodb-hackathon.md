A few days ago I joined the [DigitalOcean MongoDB Hackathon](https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/) together with a group of friends.

Even though the official objective of joining the Hackathon is to be awarded a prize, I believe all of us shared a few other goals:
1. We want to learn and explore new web technologies
2. We want to apply best practices which may be useful in our day-to-day jobs...
3. But first of all we want to have fun!

What are we going to develop and submit to the Hackathon?
Stay tuned, I will shed some light very soon...
