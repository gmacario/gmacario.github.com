Improvements and things still to be done
========================================


Workflow:

1. Take note of new ideas by appending new items to the Backlog
2. Refine idea, then create a new GitHub issue and add reference in the backlog item
3. Work on issue resolution following GitHub issue workflow
4. Once the tracking issue is closed, delete item from the backlog

Backlog:

* Validate HTML files [#4](https://github.com/gmacario/gmacario.github.io/issues/4)
  * bio/gmacario-cv-en.html: Fix http://validator.w3.org/ warnings
* CI (CloudBees): Validate `*/*.html`
* CI (CloudBees): Check broken links inside `*/*.html`
