I may understand why, they already bear with me during the workday, and having to do the same also during their evenings and week-ends is definitely a huge task :wink:</p>\n<h3 id=\"project-blobfishes-kick-off\">Project blobfishes kick-off</h3>\n<p>My friends eventually gave up to my insistence, and on 2021-07-14 when we met in person to agree upon what we could develop in order to get the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/#prizes\">wonderful prizes</a> offered by DigitalOcean.</p>\n<p>From that moment on we never had the chance of meeting in person; instead, we relied upon tools such as <a href=\"https://web.telegram.org/\">Telegram</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/issues\">GitHub issues</a>.</p>\n<p>We soon realized that the time until the closing date of the hackathon (<a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/\">July 20, 2021, 11:59 pm PST</a>) was quite short, therefore we had to cut corners and agreed the scope of work.</p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"TODO\">blobfishes project page on GitHub</a> states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Blobfishes aims to be the ugliest project participating to the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/mongodb-hackathon/\">DigitalOcean MongoDB Hackathon</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-rasi\">The RASI</h3>\n<p>Based on our skills and previous knowledge we also agreed on each <a href=\"https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/blob/main/docs/rasic.md\">team member role</a>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully - since I am the eldest and the laziest member of the team - my friends did not ask me to write complex <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB queries</a> or arcane <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/it/docs/\">Node.js</a> or <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> code, but assigned me the Ops, Deploy and Documentation tasks.</p>\n<p>Like a <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-phrase-cherry-on-top#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Ccherry%20on%20top%E2%80%9D%20means,cherry%20is%20put%20on%20top.\">cherry on top of the ice cream</a>, I also contributed with my skills of ball-breaker and watchdog which I have refined during my work at <a href=\"https://www.arol.com/\">AROL</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-deliverables\">The deliverables</h2>\n<p>Well, at the end of the day our setup did work well, as we eventually <a href=\"https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/issues/24#issuecomment-883869551\">managed to have our submission accepted</a> before the Hackathon closed!</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>As it is now about time to wake up and go to work here is my short-time action plan:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Commit and publish this blog post</li>\n<li>Shower and shave myself</li>\n<li>Go to work on time by 08:00 CEST</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a longer time plan, please have a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/issues\">project backlog</a>.</p>\n<p>As the blobfishes project is released under an <a href=\"https://github.com/aquariophilie/blobfishes/blob/main/LICENSE\">Open Source license</a>, contributions are welcome :rotfl:</p>\n<!-- TODO -->\n\n<!-- EOF -->\n"},"config":{"title":"gmacario.github.io","description":"Gianpaolo Macario's public rants","social":{"github":{"name":"gmacario","link":"https://github.com/gmacario"},"twitter":{"name":"gpmacario","link":"https://www.twitter.com/gpmacario"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
